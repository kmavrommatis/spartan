======= Installation of Aragorn ==================

Server and downloads at http://mbio-serv2.mbioekol.lu.se/ARAGORN/

The tar ball only contains two files, the ARAGORN source
(aragorn1.2.36.c or similar) and a man page (aragorn.1). 
Uncompress with:

tar -xvzf aragorn1.2.36.tgz

Compiling example:

gcc -O3 -ffast-math -finline-functions -o aragorn aragorn1.2.36.c

Put the aragorn man page in a directory read by the man command. 
These directories may be listed by:

echo $MANPATH

   Set the paths and other make variables to suit your system.

   In particular, you need to specify:
   1) where executables are to be installed
   2) where data files are to be installed 
   3) where Perl is already installed on the system
   4) what the Perl binary is called (i.e. 'perl' or 'perl5')
   5) where temporary files will reside 
   6) where to install man pages

2) type 'make' to build the programs

3) type 'make install' to install the programs and man pages.


4) type 'make testrun' to run tRNAscan-SE on a sample sequence; if the
program runs with no error messages, tRNAscan-SE has been installed
correctly

5) type 'make clean' to clean up.
